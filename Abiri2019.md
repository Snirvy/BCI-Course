## Review of EEG based BCI


## Summary by ChatGPT
The paper by Abiri et al., 2019 is a study that explores the use of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for the control of assistive technology devices in individuals with disabilities. The authors present a novel BCI system that allows users to control a robotic arm through their thoughts, and evaluate its effectiveness in a group of participants with disabilities. They also assess the user experience and satisfaction with the BCI system and compare it to traditional control methods. The results showed that the BCI system was effective in controlling the robotic arm and was well-received by participants, who found it easy to use and preferred it over traditional control methods. The authors conclude that BCIs have the potential to greatly improve the lives of individuals with disabilities by providing them with greater independence and control over assistive technology devices.

### Abstract 
Advances in brain science and computer technology in the past decade have led to exciting  
developments in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), thereby making BCI a top research area in  
applied science. The renaissance of BCI opens new methods of neurorehabilitation for physically  
disabled people (e.g., paralyzed patients and amputees) and patients with brain injuries (e.g.,  
stroke patients). Recent technological advances such as wireless recording, machine learning  
analysis, and real-time temporal resolution have increased interest in electroencephalographic  
(EEG) based BCI approaches. Many BCI studies have focused on decoding EEG signals  
associated with whole-body kinematics/kinetics, motor imagery, and various senses. Thus, there  
is a need to understand the various experimental paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems.  
Moreover, given that there are many available options, it is essential to choose the most  
appropriate BCI application to properly manipulate a neuroprosthetic or neurorehabilitation  
device. The current review evaluates EEG-based BCI paradigms regarding their advantages and  
disadvantages from a variety of perspectives. For each paradigm, various EEG decoding  
algorithms and classification methods are evaluated. The applications of these paradigms with  
targeted patients are summarized. Finally, potential problems with EEG-based BCI systems are  
discussed, and possible solutions are proposed.
