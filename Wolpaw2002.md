##The 'father' of BCI

### ChatGPT Summary
The 2002 paper by Jonathan Wolpaw, entitled "Brain-computer interfaces for communication and control," is a seminal work in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). It provides an overview of the history of BCI research, the technical challenges involved in building BCIs, and the state of the art in BCI technology at the time of publication.

In the paper, Wolpaw discusses the various ways in which brain signals can be used to control computers, including the use of electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). He also reviews the different approaches used in BCI research, including signal processing techniques, feature extraction algorithms, and machine learning methods.

Wolpaw concludes the paper by outlining the future directions for BCI research and development, including the need for improved signal processing methods, better algorithms for detecting and decoding brain signals, and the development of more natural and intuitive BCI systems. The paper is considered to be a seminal work in the field of BCI and is widely cited in subsequent research in this area.



### Discussion Questions

1) According to Wolpaw (2002), medical patients. BCI was tailored for people with neuromuscular disorders. BCI is usable even when no muscular function is available. 

2) EEG is not very spatially accurate, but very temporally accurate. Non-invasive. The level of trust in EEG is not optimal 'Grand Canyon problem'. EEG is limited to medical cases in the time of Wolpaw & no technology to analyze signals in real time. Though relatively cheap & portable (these days). Also EEG can't accurately read from deeper structures for example emotions. 

3)    
- Dependent vs Independent: 
	- VEP (dependent): still depends on other channels of movement eg. eye movement & other muscle channels
	-
	- P300 (independent): does not require any muscular activity or eye movement. Depends on the attention which is intentionally allocated by the user.  

- Invasive vs Noninvasive: The level of how close it is to your brain (through the bone/skull yes/no). 

- Evoked vs Spontaneous: 
	- Evoked = Neural reaction to a timed stimulus. Can show stimulus to get brain activity.
	- Spontaneous = Look at some feature of the brain, generated by the subject through their intent. There is no stimulus you can show to the user to generate this signal.  

4) 
-  Human / user
- Collection / signal aquisition
- Signal processing : 1) Feature extraction 2) Translation
- Feedback 

5) Feedback is important because the use of BCI is a skill that needs to be trained/ learned

6)
-  BCI algorithm adapts to user features: every person is different
- Periodic online adjustment
- Complete adaptive feedback loop

7)
