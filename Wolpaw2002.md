##The 'father' of BCI

### ChatGPT Summary
The 2002 paper by Jonathan Wolpaw, entitled "Brain-computer interfaces for communication and control," is a seminal work in the field of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). It provides an overview of the history of BCI research, the technical challenges involved in building BCIs, and the state of the art in BCI technology at the time of publication.

In the paper, Wolpaw discusses the various ways in which brain signals can be used to control computers, including the use of electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). He also reviews the different approaches used in BCI research, including signal processing techniques, feature extraction algorithms, and machine learning methods.

Wolpaw concludes the paper by outlining the future directions for BCI research and development, including the need for improved signal processing methods, better algorithms for detecting and decoding brain signals, and the development of more natural and intuitive BCI systems. The paper is considered to be a seminal work in the field of BCI and is widely cited in subsequent research in this area.

### Abstract

For many years people have speculated that electroencephalographic activity or other electrophysiological measures of brain function
might provide a new non-muscular channel for sending messages and commands to the external world – a brain–computer interface (BCI).
Over the past 15 years, productive BCI research programs have arisen. Encouraged by new understanding of brain function, by the advent of
powerful low-cost computer equipment, and by growing recognition of the needs and potentials of people with disabilities, these programs
concentrate on developing new augmentative communication and control technology for those with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brainstem stroke, and spinal cord injury. The immediate goal is to provide these users, who may be completely
paralyzed, or ‘locked in’, with basic communication capabilities so that they can express their wishes to caregivers or even operate word
processing programs or neuroprostheses. Present-day BCIs determine the intent of the user from a variety of different electrophysiological
signals. These signals include slow cortical potentials, P300 potentials, and mu or beta rhythms recorded from the scalp, and cortical neuronal
activity recorded by implanted electrodes. They are translated in real-time into commands that operate a computer display or other device.
Successful operation requires that the user encode commands in these signals and that the BCI derive the commands from the signals. Thus,
the user and the BCI system need to adapt to each other both initially and continually so as to ensure stable performance. Current BCIs have
maximum information transfer rates up to 10–25 bits/min. This limited capacity can be valuable for people whose severe disabilities prevent
them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. At the same time, many possible applications of BCI technology, such
as neuroprosthesis control, may require higher information transfer rates. Future progress will depend on: recognition that BCI research and
development is an interdisciplinary problem, involving neurobiology, psychology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science; identi-
fication of those signals, whether evoked potentials, spontaneous rhythms, or neuronal firing rates, that users are best able to control
independent of activity in conventional motor output pathways; development of training methods for helping users to gain and maintain
that control; delineation of the best algorithms for translating these signals into device commands; attention to the identification and
elimination of artifacts such as electromyographic and electro-oculographic activity; adoption of precise and objective procedures for
evaluating BCI performance; recognition of the need for long-term as well as short-term assessment of BCI performance; identification
of appropriate BCI applications and appropriate matching of applications and users; and attention to factors that affect user acceptance of
augmentative technology, including ease of use, cosmesis, and provision of those communication and control capacities that are most
important to the user. Development of BCI technology will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed research publications and
avoidance of the hyperbolic and often misleading media attention that tends to generate unrealistic expectations in the public and skepticism
in other researchers. With adequate recognition and effective engagement of all these issues, BCI systems could eventually provide an
important new communication and control option for those with motor disabilities and might also give those without disabilities a supple-
mentary control channel or a control channel useful in special circumstances. q2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

### Discussion Questions

1) According to Wolpaw (2002), medical patients. BCI was tailored for people with neuromuscular disorders. BCI is usable even when no muscular function is available. 

2) EEG is not very spatially accurate, but very temporally accurate. Non-invasive. The level of trust in EEG is not optimal 'Grand Canyon problem'. EEG is limited to medical cases in the time of Wolpaw & no technology to analyze signals in real time. Though relatively cheap & portable (these days). Also EEG can't accurately read from deeper structures for example emotions. 

3)    
- Dependent vs Independent: 
	- VEP (dependent): still depends on other channels of movement eg. eye movement & other muscle channels
	-
	- P300 (independent): does not require any muscular activity or eye movement. Depends on the attention which is intentionally allocated by the user.  

- Invasive vs Noninvasive: The level of how close it is to your brain (through the bone/skull yes/no). 

- Evoked vs Spontaneous: 
	- Evoked = Neural reaction to a timed stimulus. Can show stimulus to get brain activity.
	- Spontaneous = Look at some feature of the brain, generated by the subject through their intent. There is no stimulus you can show to the user to generate this signal.  

4) 
-  Human / user
- Collection / signal aquisition
- Signal processing : 1) Feature extraction 2) Translation
- Feedback 

5) Feedback is important because the use of BCI is a skill that needs to be trained/ learned

6)
-  BCI algorithm adapts to user features: every person is different
- Periodic online adjustment
- Complete adaptive feedback loop

7)
