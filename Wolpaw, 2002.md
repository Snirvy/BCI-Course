The father of BCI
Review of state of the art in 2002

### Discussion Questions

1) According to Wolpaw (2002), medical patients. BCI was tailored for people with neuromuscular disorders. BCI is usable even when no muscular function is available. 

2) EEG is not very spatially accurate, but very temporally accurate. Non-invasive. The level of trust in EEG is not optimal 'Grand Canyon problem'. EEG is limited to medical cases in the time of Wolpaw & no technology to analyze signals in real time. Though relatively cheap & portable (these days). Also EEG can't accurately read from deeper structures for example emotions. 

3)    
- Dependent vs Independent: 
	- VEP (dependent): still depends on other channels of movement eg. eye movement & other muscle channels
	-
	- P300 (independent): does not require any muscular activity or eye movement. Depends on the attention which is intentionally allocated by the user.  

- Invasive vs Noninvasive: The level of how close it is to your brain (through the bone/skull yes/no). 

- Evoked vs Spontaneous: 
	- Evoked = Neural reaction to a timed stimulus. Can show stimulus to get brain activity.
	- Spontaneous = Look at some feature of the brain, generated by the subject through their intent. There is no stimulus you can show to the user to generate this signal.  

4) 
-  Human / user
- Collection / signal aquisition
- Signal processing : 1) Feature extraction 2) Translation
- Feedback 

5) Feedback is important because the use of BCI is a skill that needs to be trained/ learned

6)
-  BCI algorithm adapts to user features: every person is different
- Periodic online adjustment
- Complete adaptive feedback loop

7)
