### Question 1
What are the immediate goals of BCI technology? ([[Wolpaw, 2002]])
- To provide locked in patients with a communication channel
- To help patients with severe neuromuscular disorders

Justification: paper from 2 decades ago, focuses on patients, pick two options related to medical field. Also 2 points for this questions.

! Find out how the field evolved, how individual authors view BCI. For Jonathan Wolpaw it was medical. We are supposed to find author motivations. 

### Question 2
Basic design of BCI system loop -> fill in the graph 
A = signal aquisition
B = feature extraction
C = translation

### Question 3
What is the least understood factor affecting BCI capabilities?
- User training

Justification: BCI illiteracy & inefficiency are big. BCI usage is a skill and requires training. If we can find a way to break user training that is going to be a revolution. 

### Question 4
- What is the difference between user & system performance? 

User perfomance relates to being able to provide the right signal to the BCI. 

System performance relates to how good the AI model is at classifying the provided features.
