## BCI for people without disabilities

### Why?
- Use BCI as addition to natural input we have
#### Direct control (mouse/keyboard replacement etc.)
- Flight simulator motor imagery

#### Implicit control
- Passive BCI
- Track user state over time to have computer adapt to you
- Car of the future -> track workload
- Reinforcement learning -> learn positive peaks as good movement
