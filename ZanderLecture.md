## BCI for people without disabilities

### ChatGPT summary
In the field of BCI, direct control refers to a system where a person uses their brain signals to directly control an external device, such as a cursor on a computer screen. Neuroadaptivity, on the other hand, refers to a system that adapts to the user's brain signals in real-time, allowing for more natural and intuitive control. This shift from direct control to neuroadaptivity may reflect a growing understanding of the complexities of the brain and a desire to develop BCI systems that are more closely aligned with the way the brain works.

### Why?
- Use BCI as addition to natural input we have
#### Direct control (mouse/keyboard replacement etc.)
- Flight simulator motor imagery

#### Implicit control
- Passive BCI
- Track user state over time to have computer adapt to you
- Car of the future -> track workload
- Reinforcement learning -> learn positive peaks as good movement
